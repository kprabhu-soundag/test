# soundDMR

There are a number of steps in our differential methylation pipeline that run through the use of in-house scripts.  


## Pre-requisites
We need to run Megalodon/Deep-Signal Plant to calculate methylation levels at each cytosine for each individual.  If focussing on a small part fo the genome, these bed files must be subset using bedtools intersect to focus on specific regions of the genome.

## Installation
Make sure you have access to the latest version of the package and go through the installation steps below. This can be done either by downloading the tar file from our [github](https://github.com/SoundAg/DMR_analysis) page or by cloning it in your local environment.
This only needs to be done once.

## Data availability
Sample data is available on the [github](https://github.com/SoundAg/sounDMR) page which includes methyl bed files for 2 treated and control individuals each along with Experimental-ID file and Gene-corodinates file for the ZoomFrame.
